This is a Game of Life implementation I did a while ago. 
I had it setup for output to console and I was mucking around with a little game made with dots 
when it dawned on me to apply my game of life code onto it. 
I think I was experimenting with the rules so that it would go for longevity. 
I think I might add more stuff to do so that the user can control different aspects of the rules
and the speed of the simulation. I would also like to add a generation counter so you can see 
how long the setup survived and choose to save the setup and replay it later.
